# Current task: prove and implement SCC-intrusion Function inference

Updated: 2026-09-29. Branch: `research/simple-sub-intrusion`.

## Objective

Prove that the SCC-intrusion redesign can match the frozen Yulang2 Oracle's
capabilities on an explicit supported input envelope, then implement the
replacement inference machine on this branch. F5 Function generalization and
closed schemes are to be removed from the target architecture. The user's
current objective authorizes completing the proof/design and implementation
work; unresolved semantic choices still need a reviewed successor contract
before code depends on them. Frozen Yulang2 `main` at `a58eefc3` remains the
observable reference. Do not modify frozen `main`.

## Inputs and existing contracts

- `notes/design/2026-09-29-scc-intrusion-generalization-sketch.md`
- `notes/design/2026-09-29-intrude-effect-hygiene.md`
- Existing F5 contract to supersede through an approved successor: `notes/design/2026-09-21-f5-general-function-scheme-foundation-draft.md`, especially §§8–9, 23, 25, and 33. It is not this redesign's acceptance criterion.
- The prior `yulang3` branch retains the in-progress F5c task state at parent commit `32f0a063`; its guarded-cycle measurement budgets are consumed as recorded in the linked plans/checkpoints there.

## Active gate

Replacement-design charter: `notes/design/2026-09-29-scc-intrusion-redesign-charter.md`.
The initial source/test ledger is in
`notes/progress/2026-09-29-intrusion-oracle-ledger.md`. It confirms in-place
level aging in Yulang2 and records a few identity/instantiation witnesses;
source-level and mutual-SCC cases remain open. Next, complete those Oracle
observations, then define the new abstract intrusion semantics against them.
Do not make F5's Q/R shape, closed schemes, numbering, or resource contract
the pass condition.

The reviewed pure-F5 protocol exposed a mistaken compatibility premise and is
retained only as historical review evidence. The new lifecycle obligations
derived from Oracle SCC scheduling are recorded in the ledger. The overall
goal is proof followed by implementation, not research-only completion.

## Stop conditions and next action

Before implementation, prove the candidate semantics for its declared graph
class and supported input envelope, then record the reviewed successor
contract. Stop or revise if it
captures an enclosing non-generic variable, merges distinct polarized
constraints, shares substitutions across independent uses, loses a recursive
bound, or changes Oracle-observable behavior inside the supported envelope.
Effect hygiene and runtime freshness remain a later separate gate.

Finite examples characterize the candidate but do not alone prove soundness or
principality. Do not run guarded-cycle resource captures: the current F5c plans
on `yulang3` have consumed their authorized runs. The immediate work remains
Oracle characterization: source-level mutual SCCs and independent
two-distinct-type uses are still missing; then formalize and review the
intrusion simulation before choosing its production representation.
