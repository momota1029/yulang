# Current task: prove and implement SCC-intrusion Function inference

Updated: 2026-09-29. Branch: `research/simple-sub-intrusion`.

## Objective

Prove that the SCC-intrusion redesign can match the frozen Yulang2 Oracle's
capabilities on an explicit supported input envelope, then implement the
replacement inference machine on this branch. F5 Function generalization and
closed schemes are to be removed from the target architecture. The user's
current objective authorizes completing the proof/design and implementation
work; unresolved semantic choices still need a reviewed successor contract
before code depends on them. Frozen Yulang2 `main` at `a58eefc3` remains the
observable reference. Do not modify frozen `main`.

## Inputs and existing contracts

- `notes/design/2026-09-29-scc-intrusion-generalization-sketch.md`
- `notes/design/2026-09-29-intrude-effect-hygiene.md`
- Existing F5 contract to supersede through an approved successor: `notes/design/2026-09-21-f5-general-function-scheme-foundation-draft.md`, especially §§8–9, 23, 25, and 33. It is not this redesign's acceptance criterion.
- The prior `yulang3` branch retains the in-progress F5c task state at parent commit `32f0a063`; its guarded-cycle measurement budgets are consumed as recorded in the linked plans/checkpoints there.

## Active gate

Replacement-design charter: `notes/design/2026-09-29-scc-intrusion-redesign-charter.md`.
The Oracle ledger is in
`notes/progress/2026-09-29-intrusion-oracle-ledger.md`. It now includes a
reproduced source-level identity used at both `int` and Function types, plus an
unproductive mutual-recursion result and the scheduler's forward-cycle
fixture. A nominal-guarded mutual Function SCC also yields one recursive bound
per member in a temporary Oracle probe. A local diamond probe also confirms
that an enclosing non-generic variable remains shared across two result paths
and is not quantified by the inner function. A source probe for a nested local
SCC sharing such an enclosing variable failed because sequential local `my`
declarations do not resolve the forward member reference; this exact graph
case remains open and needs an accepted source construction or graph-level
characterization. A pure Function guarded mutual cycle was also observed to
collapse to `any -> any -> never` for both members, without recursive bounds;
other cycle shapes remain open. The first Gate B candidate model is drafted in
`notes/design/2026-09-29-intrusion-abstract-semantics-draft.md`: immutable
frozen graph, boundary parent ports, outer identity preservation, and
per-incoming-use overlays. This turn added the Oracle's operational closure
rules for the pure graph fragment and corrected the candidate to one parent
per TypeVar with separate lower/upper edge transport; preserving full
intervals remains an unproved key lemma. Next define the solution ordering,
build an independent finite graph model, and test the listed polarity/use/cycle
counterexamples before stating the simulation theorem. Do not make
F5's Q/R shape, closed schemes, numbering, or resource contract the pass
condition.

The reviewed pure-F5 protocol exposed a mistaken compatibility premise and is
retained only as historical review evidence. The new lifecycle obligations
derived from Oracle SCC scheduling are recorded in the ledger. The overall
goal is proof followed by implementation, not research-only completion.

## Stop conditions and next action

Before implementation, prove the candidate semantics for its declared graph
class and supported input envelope, then record the reviewed successor
contract. Stop or revise if it
captures an enclosing non-generic variable, merges distinct polarized
constraints, shares substitutions across independent uses, loses a recursive
bound, or changes Oracle-observable behavior inside the supported envelope.
Effect hygiene and runtime freshness remain a later separate gate.

Finite examples characterize the candidate but do not alone prove soundness or
principality. Do not run guarded-cycle resource captures: the current F5c plans
on `yulang3` have consumed their authorized runs. The immediate work remains
Oracle characterization of the open graph cases, then formalization and
independent review of the intrusion simulation before choosing its production
representation.
