# Coupled effect-interface core (draft)

- Date: 2026-10-01
- Status: Draft; non-authoritative; not implementation-ready
- Scope: one mathematical carrier for ordinary effects, shallow handlers,
  typed-family constraints, and SCC lifecycle transport
- Implementation authority: none
- Inputs: user direction to prefer a small unified theory; the reviewed
  intrusion redesign charter; current effect and handler proof records

## Purpose

This note consolidates the preferred *shape* of the successor theory. It is
not a selected effect calculus and does not supply missing source semantics.
Its organizing idea is that source constructs relate complete typed
computation interfaces. Row operations, handler residuals, callback effects,
and SCC lifecycle steps are derived views or relational compositions, rather
than separate source-site constraint systems.

The design target remains soundness and principality relative to the selected
expressible abstraction. Exact execution traces are the soundness reference;
the inferred interface may conservatively over-approximate them. No
continuation-use or linearity discipline is required without independent
language-design authority.

## One semantic carrier

Fix imported identities `ρ`. Let `β` be the identities owned by one component
and `ν` an admissible assignment to them. For each complete component root,
an interface records its value type and every immediate or latent computation
view observable by clients. A computation view contains:

- a may-bound on typed requests;
- symbolic request arguments and operation payload/result constraints;
- occurrence and owner incidence needed by future generalization;
- origin and boundary lineage needed to determine handler eligibility.

The component meaning is one relation:

```text
Rel_C(ρ) ⊆ { (ν, I) | ν assigns β and I is a complete root interface }
```

The relation couples roots, request views, symbolic constraints, owners, and
routes. A row, obligation ledger, or dependency edge is a finite presentation
or projection of this relation. None is the semantic authority separately.
In particular, a typed-family invariant remains a predicate over symbolic
argument endpoints and the source-derived shared occurrence identity inside
`Rel_C`; solving may substitute its endpoints or discharge it with proof, but
materialized row comparison cannot recreate it after it has been dropped.

The meaning of typed request inclusion and the source rule that creates a
shared invariant argument group still need definition. The core does not
assume that support inclusion, common-witness compatibility, and handler
eligibility are the same predicate. They are observations of different
coordinates in the same coupled relation: request denotation, symbolic type
admissibility, and dynamic boundary visibility respectively.

## Source constructs as relational composition

Each source construct denotes a relation from its input interfaces and
constraints to its output interface. Sequential evaluation composes those
relations; may-effect join is the support projection of that composition.
The following familiar operations then have one derivation pattern:

- **Row inclusion and filters:** constrain the request-support projection of
  two interfaces. Filtering is the corresponding restricted interface
  relation, retaining all symbolic endpoint and owner constraints that its
  result depends on.
- **Splitting and union:** project or combine request-support coordinates.
  This alone says nothing about whether a handler transformer distributes
  over a split; that equation requires a theorem for the transformer.
- **Callbacks and latent effects:** compose invocation of one interface with
  the callback interface supplied to it. The callback's possible requests
  become part of the caller's computation according to the source evaluation
  relation. They are not inferred from Oracle weight movement.
- **Shallow handlers:** relationally map the full continuation-bearing
  computation interface through the source handler semantics. The residual is
  the output support projection. A request can be removed only when the
  semantics proves that every request represented by that portion is covered
  and eligible at the relevant activation. The route evidence is a genuine
  coordinate of the relation, not a row selector.

These descriptions are a common denotational interface, not a claim that each
operation is a homomorphism. In particular, a handler may fail to preserve
union exactly because a may-row forgets correlations between requests and
continuations. Soundness requires an over-approximation of the relational
image; principality asks for the most-general representable result in the
chosen interface language.

### Handler transfer as a relational image

Let `C_ρ(I)` be the set of well-typed continuation-bearing computations
represented by a complete interface `I` over fixed imports `ρ`. It includes
the values, captured environments, latent function/thunk behavior, and
activation lineage needed to interpret later calls and forces. Let `H_κ` be
the source shallow-handler transformation at activation context `κ`. The
context includes the active handler stack and the source-defined visibility
relation; it is not calculated from a family row alone. Require `H_κ` to be
defined for every computation in `C_ρ(I)`. If typing can establish only an
existential subset, the universal abstraction below is not justified.

For an interface relation `R` over owned valuations and root interfaces,
define its concrete fiber and the least semantic output relation:

```text
C_ρ(R, ν) = ⋃ { C_ρ(I) | (ν, I) ∈ R }

H#_κ(R) = { (ν, J) |
    there are c ∈ C_ρ(R, ν) and c' with c' = H_κ(c),
    and J is the complete interface observation of c' }
```

Here the complete observation includes output values with their latent
interfaces, typed request facts, symbolic argument constraints, occurrence
ownership, and route lineage. The relation keeps `ν` fixed during transfer,
so this image cannot validate a typed-family condition only after erasing its
symbolic endpoints. The induced support view is the may-row effect of the
handler. No `Drop` operation is part of this definition.

**Conditional transfer theorem.** If (1) `C_ρ(R,ν)` covers every concrete
scrutinee represented by `R`, (2) `H_κ` is total on that fiber and agrees
with the source shallow-handler transition, and (3) the output interface
observation is sound for every result `H_κ(c)`, then `H#_κ(R)` is sound:
every concrete handled result represented on an input fiber is represented
on the corresponding output fiber. Moreover, among exact relations over the
chosen complete-interface carrier, `H#_κ(R)` is the least sound relational
image: any relation containing the observation of every such `H_κ(c)` must
contain `H#_κ(R)`. This is leastness for the semantic transfer, not a proof
that the image has a finite formula, that a solver computes it, or that the
whole type inference system is principal.

The shallow operational cases are consequences of the same image. A covered
visible request enters its arm with the raw continuation; a request not
selected at this activation is forwarded with the shallow wrapper around its
continuation; any request emitted by an arm is observed in that arm's output
computation. A one-shot family removal is valid only if the image proves the
family absent from every output observation represented by that fiber. When
the carrier cannot express that fact, it must keep the family or use a sound
coarser image. Thus `Drop` certificates, route ledgers, and `Demand` edges can
serve as proof or implementation evidence for computing this image, but none
is an independent semantic rule.

This removes source-site-specific subtraction from the mathematical core,
but the transfer remains deliberately abstract. A family may occur in an
input path and not in the output path after non-resumption; another may escape
only through a resumed raw continuation; an incomplete or invisible request
is forwarded. The transformer distinguishes these by executing the same
shallow relation on continuation-bearing computations, not by applying one
row-level subtraction formula. For may-rows, the computable result must
over-approximate the support of `H#`; it must not assume that `H#` distributes
over row union.

The unresolved work is to define a finite symbolic representation whose
denotation is this dependent relation and whose output projection is both
computable and principal. In particular, symbolic typed-family invariance,
owner incidence, and route lineage must survive in the formula presented to
the solver. Grounding each fiber and rebuilding those constraints from
materialized rows would not implement this definition.

### The collecting support projection and two kinds of union

For one fixed admissible valuation `ν`, let `γ(A,ν)` be the concrete
continuation-bearing computations represented by an abstract input interface
`A`. Define the handler's may-support reference transfer by:

```text
May_H(A, ν) = ⋃ { TraceSupport(H_κ(c)) | c ∈ γ(A, ν) }
```

`TraceSupport` is a set of typed request instances appearing on finite traces
of the handled computation, including arm requests and requests exposed by
shallow resumption. The definition is indexed by `ν`, rather than merging
ground instances from different valuations. The symbolic input relation
continues to state which valuations and occurrence groups are admissible.

For this fixed fiber, the support theorem is direct: every result represented
by `γ(A,ν)` has each of its finite-trace requests in `May_H(A,ν)`. It is also
least in the full powerset of typed request instances: if a set `E` bounds
every result of `H_κ` on `γ(A,ν)`, then every element of the union defining
`May_H(A,ν)` belongs to `E`. This exact collecting projection is a semantic
reference, not a requirement that the compiler track exact traces or
continuation usage. A practical finite row language may over-approximate this
set; its principality claim must then be relative to its own expressible
ordering and denotation.

Two unions must not be conflated. Relational disjunction `R ∪ S` chooses one
of two complete interface relations. Pointwise row join `A ⊔row B` combines
support coordinates inside an interface and admits computations that mix
requests from both rows. The first obeys exact relational-image distribution
for a fixed `H_κ`, because its concretization is a union. For row join,
`γ(A,ν) ∪ γ(B,ν) ⊆ γ(A ⊔row B,ν)`, so monotonicity gives only:

```text
May_H(A,ν) ∪ May_H(B,ν) ⊆ May_H(A ⊔row B,ν)
```

Equality requires an additional theorem about the row concretization and
handler behavior. A finite row abstraction that forgets correlations may make
the inclusion strict. This distinction is why relational composition can be
the common core while splitting a may-row cannot by itself justify applying a
handler transfer separately to each half.

For the direct shallow fragment, the trace rules give the corresponding
operational cases: `Return` executes the value arm; a covered, eligible
request executes its operation arm with the raw continuation; an uncovered or
ineligible request is forwarded with the handler around its continuation.
Applying the support projection to those outputs includes arm effects, keeps
forwarded requests, and includes any suffix exposed by raw resumption. This
checks the image definition against the direct trace model without introducing
a separate subtraction rule. The callback/thunk visibility extension and its
finite symbolic presentation remain open, so this is not yet the complete
source-to-inference proof.

The callback `call` / `invoke` witness is an instance of ordinary invocation
composition. Its pure argument permits a small sequencing lemma, but that
lemma is evidence for the general relation, not a callback-specific source
rule. Effectful or deferred argument behavior must come from the source
computation semantics. No runtime `pure_mono` test is promoted into the
mathematical core.

## One lifecycle relation, distinct preservation laws

All lifecycle operations act on the complete coupled relation, including
typed-family formulas and their incidence:

```text
solve            substitute symbolic endpoints, preserving the relation
residualize      relational image through the source handler/effect context
generalize       retain the fixed-ρ fiber while quantifying owned identities
instantiate      capture-avoiding renaming of one use's owned identities
intrude          transport through parent map P and boundary map Θ
```

The proof obligations differ even though the carrier is shared. Solving needs
solution-fiber preservation. Residualization needs sound relational image and
least representable projection. Generalization needs exact fixed-`ρ` fiber
projection and the independent-use product law. Fresh instantiation needs
equivariance under one consistent renaming of every occurrence and formula.
Injective intrusion may use the same kind of equivariance; non-injective
intrusion needs a quotient theorem preserving every observable root and
request/handler view. No single renaming slogan proves all these cases.

`P` and `Θ` may remain separate implementation maps because they act on
different identities. Mathematically they are components of one transport
action on `Rel_C`; symbolic family endpoints and evidence payloads receive
`P`, while boundary lineage receives `Θ`. A type substitution never erases
boundary evidence merely because request support becomes equal.

## Principality and finite presentation

The relation above is intentionally more expressive than any proposed solver:
an unrestricted set of satisfying interfaces may not have a finite
presentation or terminating principal projection. The successor must select
an expressible fragment and define subsumption on its complete interfaces.
For fixed imports `ρ`, a principal result must denote the most-general
representable interface satisfying the source constraints, and separate
incoming uses must denote independently renamed copies over the same rigid
`ρ`. This criterion is relative to the chosen abstraction, not to exact trace
support and not to Oracle's intermediate scheme formatting.

Three candidate presentations remain to compare:

1. finite typed may-rows with symbolic family constraints;
2. constrained interface formulas whose denotation is `Rel_C(ρ)`;
3. a finite abstraction of continuation-bearing computation relations.

Compare them for soundness, representability, termination, principality,
composition, and proof reuse. Prefer the smallest one that satisfies the
proofs. A selector, obligation kind, or source-specific rule is justified only
if a source-level distinction cannot be expressed as a relation or projection
of this carrier. If Oracle routing conflicts with these proofs, record the
concrete counterexample, the dropped Oracle behavior, the adopted rule, and
the final-acceptance impact.

## Open gates

This draft does not yet define the supported source semantics or prove the
carrier adequate. Before a successor contract or implementation, establish:

1. declarative source computation, callback, thunk, and shallow-handler
   relations, including activation-specific visibility;
2. sound may-row and typed-family denotations whose symbolic invariance
   survives solving, residualization, generalization, instantiation, and
   intrusion;
3. a finite terminating principal presentation and its relation to the
   carrier;
4. SCC/root closure and parent-map preservation for the declared source
   envelope;
5. explicit counterexample search for repeated pushes/one pop, nested
   frames, complete and incomplete handlers, and residual effects;
6. final well-typed-program acceptance comparison over the supported envelope.

Method selection, roles, and implementation resolution remain a later
mandatory gate. Begin that gate only after ordinary effect and handler
semantics are settled, unless a concrete dependency appears earlier.
