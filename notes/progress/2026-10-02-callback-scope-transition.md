# Callback-scope transition characterization

Branch: `research/simple-sub-intrusion`
Status: design investigation; no source rule selected

## Question

Does a nested concrete callback receiver preserve or shadow an enclosing
receiver's capture incidence while the nested `CallView` adapts the callback
result? The question is about one clause in the common activation-context
relation, not a reason to add a callback selector or a new row obligation.

## Frozen characterization

The witness is `/tmp/yulang-helper-capture-concrete.yu`:

```yu
pub act choose:
  pub get: () -> unit

pub invoke(f: () -> [choose] ()) = f()
pub handle(f: () -> [choose] ()) = catch invoke(f):
  choose::get, k -> k ()
  v -> v
pub result = handle(\() -> choose::get())
```

The frozen CLI `check --no-prelude --no-cache` accepts it. `dump --poly-raw`
reports `ret_eff=Bot` for `invoke` and `handle`; `dump --mono` places the
callback-result force inside `invoke`; `run --interpreter` then reports an
unhandled `choose::get`. Wildcard-helper and direct-receiver controls succeed.
This is a checker/runtime mismatch, not authority for either runtime routing
or a successor rule. In particular, the Oracle's empty row is not to be copied
if it erases a request that the successor execution relation leaves outward.

## Candidate clauses in the same theory

1. Preserve the enclosing capture incidence through nested call and adaptation.
   This is the compositional context-extension candidate. The outer handler can
   consume the request only if the complete source transition and universal
   handler-image proof establish visibility, coverage, and typed compatibility.
   It fits the documented receiving-function capture promise, but has not been
   shown by the witness or frozen runtime.
2. Let an inner concrete receiver shadow the enclosing incidence for that
   transition. Any request not consumed by a proved handler step remains in
   outward support. This can be sound, but may reject an outer-handler program
   accepted by Oracle and needs a source-level precedence rule. A larger row is
   not by itself a principality failure; principality is relative to this
   selected source semantics and its expressible abstraction.

Both clauses use the same ordered context, source-owned request incidence,
typed-family formula, `CallView`/`Adapt`, and whole-computation handler image.
This keeps `Sel_s`, `Demand`, route records, and transport maps as derived
views or proof bookkeeping. Candidate 1 is conceptually cheaper if source
simulation proves it; candidate 2 cannot be chosen merely to fit the frozen
route. The author has not selected either clause.

## Reviews

- **architect**: the witness cannot select either candidate; keep the
  concrete-on-concrete relation open within the common ordered context.
- **compiler_referee**: candidate 1 needs a source/runtime simulation across
  argument adaptation, call, result adaptation, origin eligibility, shallow
  resumption, and symbolic `K,D` transport. Candidate 2 must retain all
  unconsumed support. A family match alone must not capture an unrelated
  caller-owned request.
- **spec_auditor**: frozen public references establish a scoped capture
  promise, not nested-contract precedence or universal sticky composition;
  runtime markers characterize re-entry only. No source rule or implementation
  approval follows.

The three reviews converge: this is a genuine source-semantic decision, not an
Oracle implementation fact. The exact request lifetime and caller-handler
eligibility remain unresolved. The later method/roles/impl-resolution gate is
unchanged and must wait until ordinary effect/handler semantics is settled.

## Next proof gate

Define one source call/handler transition over ordered activation contexts and
request origins, derive both candidate clauses from that relation, and compare
their final well-typed-program acceptance. Preserve symbolic typed-family
argument invariance through solving, residualization, call, force, handler
image, generalization, fresh instantiation, and intrusion at the same
assignment. Do not begin method,
role, or impl-resolution work before ordinary effect/handler semantics closes,
unless a proved dependency requires it earlier. No compiler code or tests were
changed or run. `git diff --check` is the only mechanical check for this
record/design slice.
